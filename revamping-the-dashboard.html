                <li>The job the user has to do is the same across parking locations but the data set is unique to that

                Given the deadline and goal of the project, I addressed this problem by starting with what was easy:

                <li>
                  <b>Transient data grouped selectively:</b> this is any data that was ever-changing. It was difficult
                  to understand the relationship between moving parts. I addressed this issue by focusing on simplifying
                  the menu for example: introducing a "tab"-like element within the navigation bar.

                As a seperate task for the client, I was asked to brainstorm a
                wizard set-up flow that reduced the use of lengthy forms when
                users are tasked with creating parking sites.
                <br /><br />
                I advocated for visually illustrating the task of mapping
                parking sites as the first step because users are more likely
                to learn if the UI matches their respective real life tasks.
                The following complex UI screen was designed as a starting
                point for further discussions with the rest of team.

                  Despite redesigning a narrowed-down list of menu-items for the navigation bar, I later learned some
                  interactive
                  components triggered changes to datasets and data files in
                  other areas of the system without the user's knowledge (super confusing).

                  <br /><br />
                  For example, if an user updated the parking fee attributes
                  for a single vehicle, it could override other billing
                  charges across accounts (unbeknownst to the user who made
                  the change).
                  <br /><br />
                  Discovering this issue threw a major wrench in the works due to the complexity of redesigning for
                  status changes and alerts. Keeping the client's goal in mind for the redesign, I proposed using the
                  dashboard UI to highlight as many of the uncomplicated status changes as possible.

                The biggest challenge was the difficulty in mapping attributes
                and contingencies for dataset relationships by business value
                in a simpler way than how it was initially shown.
                <br /><br />Besides feedback from product owners, defining the
                dataset by universal heuristic patterns (ex. more information
                leads to more confusion) was a quick win that ultimately
                guided the design direction of the rest of the application
                towards a "less is more" solution.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="block-text">
                Stakeholders had a general idea of the kind of information
                they wanted to see as part of the final design. I was hesitant
                to accept the client's design requests without fully
                comprehending why (if at all) the changes would benefit the
                user. <br /><br />In most cases, I would advocate for the
                end-user and insist on defining user needs with the client.
                However, in this case, I chose to trust the client's word
                because they were by nature and as an office culture: open,
                collaborative, and resourceful for all the user data that was
                lacking. Such an environment allowed me to comfortably clarify
                or update other parts of the design without delays to the
                overall contract timeline. It made for a pleasureable work
                experience with the teams involved. I try to find (and reflect
                in my own engagment and behaviour) this empathetic way of
                working together.
