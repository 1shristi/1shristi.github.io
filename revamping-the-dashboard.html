                        the design solution and help narrow the project scope to just pertinent screens and user flows.

                  While spending time consolidating the menu, I later learned that pages within the menu items had
                  forms, live data tables, and other
                  auto-updating components that trigger
                  system-wide changes without users' awareness.
                  <br /><br />
                  This was a level of system telemetry that was a key business selling point but there was no observable
                  UI to reflect or communicate these status
                  changes.
                  <br /><br />
                  For example, when updating parking fees for one vehicle, it can change the billing cycle across
                  multiple accounts without the user knowing.
                  <br /><br />
                  My redesign had not considered how auto-updating components should behave or which ones should
                  trigger user engagement and permissions and which ones should be push-updates or alerts.
                  <br></br>
                  Given the client's target audience of executive buyers, my design needed to clearly show these dynamic
                  components to facilitate meaningful discussions about the product's value.

                  <br></br>
                  It also had to be simple. So I used the data I already gathered from menu item interactions to lead to
                  the solution.
                  <br>
                  Using a 2x2 frameworks, I looked at the relationship between menu items, their relationship and
                  interaction with each other.

                <b>Overview</b>
                <br /><br />
                As a separate screen within the application, I was asked to brainstorm ways to design for a set-up
                wizard onboarding new parking sites.
                <br /><br />

                The current application had multiple paged forms that took a long time to complete. It wasn't entirely
                comprehensible either.
                <br /><br />
                <b>Solution</b>
                <br /><br />
                I advocated for translating physical documents into understandable UI screens as closely as possible to
                the physical task users have to do. That meant taking users' very first step in mapping new parking
                sites, ie. using a clipboard and pen to jot down parking site numbers, and drawing UI solutions that
                could support the respective physical task.
                <br /><br />
                A direct visual translation of how users would perform the task would be clearer to understand and less
                arduous to go through step-by-step.

                <li>I was often wary of accepting client design changes, not out of defiance but because I lacked the

                  also couldn't deny that I didn't know as much as they did.
