                                    The client had a legacy system for shipping international cosmetic goods that needed
                                    to be replaced entirely. The legacy system was built on a monolithic architecture
                                    that was not only outdated but also difficult to maintain. It had become a
                                    bottleneck for the business, leading to inefficiencies and staff dissatisfaction.

                                    The client had created a detailed and comprehensive product road map for an entirely
                                    new shipping application to replace the legacy system (as part of a new marketplace
                                    SaaS). This shipping application did not have a visual component and required a
                                    designer to lead the user research and design.

                                    As a starting point, I was given 1 month to create UI screens that translated the
                                    important user flows of the legacy system into a shipping solution that was user
                                    friendly and efficient for staff to use, and capable of handling the complexities of
                                    international shipping.
