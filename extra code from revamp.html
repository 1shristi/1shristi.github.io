                    In an interview workshop setting with the client, I facilitated and adopted the perspectives of two key individuals for user interviews:

                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <br>

                        <div class="bold-text-li">
                          Subject matter expert &amp; Product owner
                        </div>
                        in order to understand the underlying business logic
                        and its product goals and value proposition.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <div class="bold-text-li">New user</div>
                        in order to define user flows of daily users, what
                        problems they are trying to solve and why itâ€™s needed.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p></p>
                    <div class="block-copy">
                      <div class="bold-text">
                        The benefits of this approach
                      </div>
                      <p class="block-text">
                    It revealed the core usability issues that my user interface needed to address, especially on the main dashboard. Additionally, by defining it as a workshop, the client could participate in the design solution and help narrow the project scope to just pertinent screens and user flows.
