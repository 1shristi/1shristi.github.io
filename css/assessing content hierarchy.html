assessing content hierarchy

Clarifying the content hierarchy was a challenge; below is a summary. For the entire process see
13 menu-items.
Static data

I collected data that didn't require user input or immediate user awareness and placed them 
in card UI elements to quickly see the current status of each parking location.

Transient data

Of the collected data that was ever-changing, I approached it creatively, for example: 'introducing a "tab"-like element within the navigation bar.

         <b>Transient data; much trickier:</b> this is any data that auto-updates multiple components across
                  the application.It was difficult to understand the complex relationship between all the moving parts
                  and there was no design roadmap
                  for observable UI. I chose to narrow down the problem by breaking down where interactions occurred.

                  <b>Transient data grouped selectively:</b> this is any data that was ever-changing. It was difficult
                  to understand the relationship between moving parts. I addressed this issue by focusing on simplifying
                  the menu for example: introducing a "tab"-like element within the navigation bar.

                 Data that changes often (ex. tracking vehicles entering or exiting a building) impacted other data elements held within menu-items. I used entity relationship diagrams to isolate the data into groups based on volatility and importance to see if the navigation menu could be consolidated and the dashboard could include some volatile data. To see details, view <a href="#deep-dive-dataset-relationships">Challenges</a>.
                    
                    Defining this complex system would take up more of the project scope. As a reminder, the purpose of this design project was to produce a visual design that reflected the application's features such that it would be a point of discussion during high stake meetings. The complexity was not part of the scope but   
                    
                    I decided investigate the data relationship in the simplest and quickest way I could by
                    To solve for this I applied entity relationship diagrams to isolate and avoid designing for complexity at the expense of smoother sales pitch (see details in <a href="#deep-dive-dataset-relationships">Challenges</a>).

                    The data kept changing, and while it needed to be accurate enough to talk through the design, it didn’t really fall within the core scope of the project. To keep things focused, I used entity relationship diagrams to isolate what mattered—avoiding overcomplication while still making the sales pitch land

                    On one hand, the frequently changing data needed to be accurate enough to support design discussions. On the other, it was outside the project's core scope. To balance both, I used entity relationship diagrams to isolate essential structures—avoiding over-designing for volatile data while still enabling a smoother, clearer sales pitch.

              <div>
                As a seperate screen within the application, I was asked to brainstorm ways to design for a
                set-up wizard onboarding new parking sites. 
                <br /><br />
               
                The current application had multiple paged forms that took a long time to complete. It wasn't entirely comprehensible either.
                <br /><br />
               I advocated for translating physical documents into understandable UI screens as closely as possible to the physical task users have to do. That meant taking users' very first step in mapping new parking sites, ie. using a clipboard and pen to jot down parking site numbers, and drawing UI solutions that could support the respective physical task. 
                <br /><br />
               A direct visual translation of how users would perfoem the task would be clearer to understand and less arduous to go through step-by-step.

                This complex UI screen was presented as a starting
                point for further discussions with the rest of the team (to the engineers' relief). With no major constraints, I had fun designing this solution using airline seating reservation flows as inspiration.
