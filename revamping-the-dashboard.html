                        Of the narrowed down list of menu-items, some interactive components can trigger changes to datasets in other areas of the system without the user's knowledge thus leading to confusion. 
                      <br><br>
                      For example, if a user updated the parking fee attributes for a single vehicle, it may override other billing charges across accounts (unbeknownst to the user who made the change).
                    <br><br>
                    By defining the relationship between the task the user completes in a menu-item, the number of interactions associated to each menu-item, and the impact the interaction has on other menu items, I narrowed the menu-items to highlight changes between:
