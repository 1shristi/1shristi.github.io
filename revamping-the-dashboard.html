                    Of the narrowed down list of menu-items, some interactive components triggered changes to datasets in other areas of the system without the user's knowledge leading to confusion.
                    <br><br>
                    For example, if a user updated the parking fee attributes for a single vehicle, it may override other billing charges across accounts (unbeknownst to the user who made the change).
                    <br><br>
                    Defining relationships by the following tasks further reduced the number of menu-items to 4 (see below) and led to discovering ways to add affordances for the dashboard screen: <br><br>(1) the task the user completes in a menu-item, (2) the number of interactions associated to each menu-item, and (3) the impact the interaction has on other menu items

                <p class="block-text">The biggest challenge was the difficulty in mapping attributes and contingencies for dataset relationships by business value in a simpler way than how it was initially shown. <br><br>Besides feedback from product owners, defining the dataset by universal heuristic patterns (ex. more information leads to more confusion) was a quick win that ultimately guided the direction of the rest of the application.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="block-text">Stakeholders had a general idea of the kind of information they wanted to see as part of the final design. I was hesitant to accept client's design requests without fully comprehending why (if at all) the changes would benefit the user. <br><br>In this case, I simply trusted the client's word because they even took the time to provide clear answers for their requests through extra meetings. This helped me clarify or update other parts of the design that the request impacted without delays to the overall timeline. It made for a pleasureable work experience with all the teams involved so I try to find (and reflect) this kind of empathetic way of working together.</p>
