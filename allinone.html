                                        process so directing the conversation around the concept is just as important as

                                        on visuals would have been a waste of their time and money
                                        at this early stage so instead, I highlighted the pressing
                                        features that the shipping application needed, how these
                                        features could be introduced to users, and what the scope of
                                        the entire design project could look like. </p><br>
