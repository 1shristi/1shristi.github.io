                                The client had a comprehensive product roadmap to replace an outdated, monolithic legacy
                                system used for shipping international cosmetic goods, which had become a bottleneck
                                over time causing inefficiencies and staff frustration.

                                        screens for presentation to key legacy system stakeholders.

                                    The client had a tight deadline for the entire product development and wanted to

                                    and resources for the entire project.

                                    a priority for the duration of the 4 weeks. </p>

                                        members who had been using the legacy system for years and had a deep
                                        understanding of its functionalities and limitations.

                                        for
                                        aligning with the PO’s expectations on what features or pain points to address.
                                        The
                                        interface should not only align with user needs but also align with expectations

                                        Often times it was the conversation about the sketches that are most important.
