                                    The client had a legacy system for shipping international cosmetic goods that needed to be replaced entirely. The legacy system was built on a monolithic architecture that was not only outdated but also difficult to maintain. It had become a bottleneck for the business, leading to inefficiencies and staff dissatisfaction.
                        
                                     <br><br>
                                    The client had created a detailed and comprehensive product road map for an entirely new shipping application to replace the legacy system (as part of a new marketplace SaaS). This shipping application did not have a visual component and required a designer to lead the user research and design. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    As a starting point, I was given 1 month to create UI screens that translated the important user flows of the legacy system into a shipping solution that was user friendly and efficient for staff to use, and capable of handling the complexities of international shipping.

                                                Given the ambitious deadline, I expressed the need to have easy and quick access to subject matter experts (SME). The SME were senior staff members who had been using the legacy system for years and had a deep understanding of its functionalities and limitations.

                                                Given the deadline, I requested daily meetings with the PO and regular meetings with the team in order to understand their UI vision for the product; this included time to read and ask questions from their research documents.
