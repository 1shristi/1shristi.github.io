                        In an interview workshop setting with the client, I facilitated and adopted the perspectives of two key individuals for user interviews:

                    It revealed the core usability issues that my user interface needed to address, especially on the main dashboard. Additionally, by defining it as a workshop, the client could participate in the design solution and help narrow the project scope to just pertinent screens and user flows.

                    Of the narrowed down list of menu-items, some interactive components triggered changes to datasets and data files in other areas of the system without the user's knowledge, confusingly.
                    <br><br>
                    For example, if a user updated the parking fee attributes for a single vehicle, it could override other billing charges across accounts (unbeknownst to the user who made the change).
                    <br><br>
                    Defining relationships by the following tasks further reduced the number of menu-items to 4 (see below) and led to discovering ways to add affordances for the dashboard screen: <br><br>(1) the task the user completes in a menu-item, (2) the number of interactions associated to each menu-item, and (3) the impact the interaction has on other menu items

                  <li> Where important information is far too complex to be in a dashboard, avoid showcasing more than necessary</li>

                <p class="block-text">The biggest challenge was the difficulty in mapping attributes and contingencies for dataset relationships by business value in a simpler way than how it was initially shown. <br><br>Besides feedback from product owners, defining the dataset by universal heuristic patterns (ex. more information leads to more confusion) was a quick win that ultimately guided the design direction of the rest of the application towards a "less is more" solution.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="block-text">Stakeholders had a general idea of the kind of information they wanted to see as part of the final design. I was hesitant to accept the client's design requests without fully comprehending why (if at all) the changes would benefit the user. <br><br>In most cases, I would advocate for the end-user and insist on defining user needs with the client. However, in this case, I chose to trust the client's word because they were by nature and as an office culture: open, collaborative, and resourceful for all the user data that was lacking. Such an environment allowed me to comfortably clarify or update other parts of the design without delays to the overall contract timeline. It made for a pleasureable work experience with the teams involved. I try to find (and reflect in my own engagment and behaviour) this empathetic way of working together.</p>
