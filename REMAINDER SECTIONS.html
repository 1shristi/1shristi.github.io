                                I have a Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction from the University of
                                Toronto, where I focused on user-centered design principles and usability testing.
                                My academic background has equipped me with the skills to conduct thorough user
                                research and apply design thinking methodologies effectively.

                                The design was implemented using Figma, which allowed for rapid prototyping and
                                collaboration with the development team. I created interactive prototypes to
                                demonstrate the user flows and gather feedback from stakeholders.
                                The final design included a series of UI screens that addressed the key pain points
                                identified during the research phase. These screens were designed to be intuitive,
                                user-friendly, and aligned with the client's vision for the new shipping platform.

                                refine the design and ensure alignment with business goals.
                                The final design was presented to the client, who expressed satisfaction with the

                                One of the main challenges was the tight deadline of 4 weeks, which required a focused
                                and
                                efficient design process. Additionally, the complexity of the legacy system and the need
                                to
                                translate its functionalities into a modern UI posed significant challenges.
                                Another challenge was ensuring that the new design aligned with the client's vision
                                while also
                                addressing user needs effectively. Balancing these requirements required careful
                                prioritization
                                and iterative feedback throughout the design process.

                                This project reinforced the importance of user research and iterative design in creating
                                effective UI solutions. The close collaboration with the PO and development team was
                                crucial
                                in ensuring that the design met both user needs and technical feasibility.
                                I learned that even with a tight deadline, a focused and structured design process can
                                yield
                                valuable results. The positive feedback from the client and stakeholders validated the
                                effectiveness of the design approach and its potential impact on improving shipping
                                operations.
